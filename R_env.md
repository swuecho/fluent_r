### search

The function search shows the current search path and so is a very useful way to keep track of which data frames and lists (and packages) have been attached and detached. Initially it gives

``` r
search()
```

    ## [1] ".GlobalEnv"        "package:stats"     "package:graphics" 
    ## [4] "package:grDevices" "package:utils"     "package:datasets" 
    ## [7] "package:methods"   "Autoloads"         "package:base"
